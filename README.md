# DapperEngine-SpaceShooter
A simple space shooter prototype built with my custom C++ game engine.

Navigate and blast obstacles without getting hit to increase your score!

The primary purpose of this prototype was to learn how to create new
features, and improve upon current ones for my game engine.
